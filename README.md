## Meet Mikasa — Your Personalized AI Assistant ✨

Hey there! I'm **Charan Konchada**, an AI enthusiast on a mission to build an AI model that works like **ChatGPT**, but with a twist — **Mikasa** remembers your preferences and evolves based on *how you* want to interact.

---

## What is Mikasa?

**Mikasa** is a personalized AI assistant powered by a local **LLM (Large Language Model)**, designed to:
- 🧠 Remember your preferences
- 🧩 Adapt its personality
- ❤️ Be more than just a chatbot — your **best friend**, **brother**, **sister**, or anything you imagine

---

## Personality Modes

- **Assistant Mode** (default): A professional, helpful, and efficient AI assistant.
- **Mikasa Mode** (custom): Fully customizable! Choose how Mikasa talks to you — casual, caring, teasing, romantic, or anything you want. You can even rename this mode to match your vibe!

---

## Prerequisites

Before running Mikasa, make sure to:

1. **Download & Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** — Required to run local LLMs.
2. After installation, open your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal** and run:

   ```
   ollama run openchat:7b
   ```

   (This will download the **OpenChat:7B** model — be patient!)

3. Once the model is ready, you’re good to go!

## Customization Guide 🎨

Want to make Mikasa truly *yours*?

- Use **Ctrl + F** in both the **Python (.py) file** and the **HTML (.html) file**.
- **Find & Replace "Mikasa"** with your favorite custom name.
- **Also replace "Charan" with your own name** wherever it appears (Hehe 😜).

**Boom! Now it’s your very own AI assistant!** 🎉

## Static Folder — Backgrounds & Live Wallpapers 🌌

- The `static` folder is used to set Mikasa’s background.
- If you want to add a **live wallpaper** (like a moving video background), you can:
  - Search for a video like **"car live wallpaper"** or any style you like on Google.
  - Download it.
  - Rename the file **exactly as**:

    ```
    Mikasa.mp4
    ```

  - Place the `Mikasa.mp4` inside the `static` folder.

- ✅ Mikasa will automatically detect and display it as a live background!
